"""Release payload builder (释放写截止).

Both the manual release endpoint and the TTL sweep funnel through
``release_payload`` so every release — manual or automatic — stamps the
row with exactly one ``cooldown_until`` deadline, computed from the
cooldown seconds in effect at the release instant. A later release
overwrites the previous deadline wholesale, so a row never carries two
overlapping cooldowns.

    """Columns to write when a claim is released.

    Clears the lock fields and sets ``cooldown_until = now + cooldown_seconds``.
    With ``cooldown_seconds <= 0`` the deadline lands at/before ``now`` and
    the cooldown is immediately over.
